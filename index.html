            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>My name is <strong>Peter Muthui</strong> a frontend and backend engineer who has been 
                interested in technology for more than four years. In college i was fascinated by programming languages like Visual Basic and Pascal
            , how both could crunch data and generate output. I and another friend was so passionate to 
        creating simple and complex programs to get deeper understanding. We go to the level of designing
    projects for the students and trainers for demonstration purposes.</p>
        <p>Next our challenge was to complete with neigbouring universities, colleges and polytechniques
            in showcasing the best project to investors who could sponsor us or get potential buyers
            and eventually we were lucky to get one buyer</p>
            <p>This was the moment that changed our lives forever particularly me. After that i landed a job with another
                company where it was my time after schooling to take my skills and knowledge to another level 
                through involvment in the company's project. It was this time where i was able to learn new systems
                like the utilization of new languages like PhP, Python and Dot.net.
